================
This tutorial covers a lot of Android API's especially focusing on the location sensor(GPS). In addition it also uses
Apache HTTP Client to POST JSON data via a POST Request using background task aka AsyncTask in android. The application 
has a edit text field where users can enter their web service url. As soon as the url is posted the app starts sending
location information of that user to the web service every two minutes.
